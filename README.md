# Temperature-Convertor-CLI
CLI Temperature Convertor App built with vanilla Python
# Temperature Converter CLI

A simple and robust command-line interface (CLI) application built with vanilla Python to convert temperature values between Celsius, Kelvin, and Fahrenheit scales. This project serves as a practical exercise in mastering Python fundamentals and applying the SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

## üåü Features

* **Bidirectional Conversion:** Convert temperatures between any two of the three supported scales: Celsius (¬∞C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (¬∞F).
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive terminal prompts guide the user through the conversion process.
* **Pure Python:** Developed using only standard Python libraries, without external frameworks, to focus on core language proficiency.
* **SOLID Principles Applied:** The codebase is structured with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and extensibility, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, and others.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x:** The core programming language.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install & Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Since you've already cloned it, you have the code! If someone else wanted to run it, they'd use:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Temperature-Converter-CLI.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Temperature-Converter-CLI.git)
    cd Temperature-Converter-CLI
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `YourGitHubUsername` and `Temperature-Converter-CLI` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)*

2.  **Run the application:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py  # Or whatever your main script file is named
    ```

## üí° How to Use

Once the application is running, follow the on-screen prompts:

1.  Enter the numerical temperature value you wish to convert.
2.  Select the initial temperature unit (Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit).
3.  Select the target temperature unit for conversion.

The application will then display the converted temperature.

## üìò Learning Focus: SOLID Principles

This project was specifically designed to apply and reinforce understanding of the **SOLID principles**:

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each function and class is designed to have only one reason to change.
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** The design allows for new temperature units or conversion methods to be added without modifying existing, tested code.
* *(You can add more here if you specifically focused on Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, or Dependency Inversion. If not, keeping it general to SRP/OCP is perfectly fine for a first iteration!)*

## ü§ù Contribution

While this is a personal learning project, feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
